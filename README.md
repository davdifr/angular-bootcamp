# Data Binding

In Angular there are four types of data binding techniques:

1. **Interpolation**: It is a one-way data binding technique, where the data is passed from the component to the view. It is denoted by double curly braces `{{ }}`.

2. **Property Binding**: It is a one-way data binding technique, where the data is passed from the component to the view. It is denoted by square brackets `[]`.

3. **Event Binding**: It is a one-way data binding technique, where the data is passed from the view to the component. It is denoted by parentheses `()`.

4. **Two-way Binding**: It is a two-way data binding technique, where the data is passed from the component to the view and vice versa. It is denoted by square brackets and parentheses `[(ngModel)]`.
