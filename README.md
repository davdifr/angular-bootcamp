# Angular Bootcamp

Welcome to the Angular Bootcamp!

Version 1.0.0 üßê

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
Node.js is essential for running the Angular CLI, which is the tool we'll use to create and manage our Angular projects.

If you haven't installed Node.js yet, follow the instructions below:

### Linux, macOS

Install nvm, with:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

Then, install Node.js with:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

### Windows

To install Node.js on Windows, you can either:

-   Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) by following its provided instructions.

-   Alternatively, download Node.js directly using the installer available at the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), please refer to the installation instructions for Linux.

## Getting Started

Install the Angular CLI globally with:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Once the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project with:

```bash
ng new angular-bootcamp
```

Well done! You've created your first Angular project. üéâ
