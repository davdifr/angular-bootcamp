⚠️ Before proceeding further, we've reorganized our components and services into new directories. All components now reside in 'src/app/components', while the click-counter service has been relocated to 'src/app/services'. This revamped structure enhances project organization and provides a clearer understanding of its architecture.

It's possible to create a new component directly in the 'src/app/components' directory by running the following command:

```bash
ng generate component components/<component-name>
```
